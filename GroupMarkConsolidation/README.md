# Group Mark Consolidation
Raeds in a csv and duplicates entries for each student number. Speeds up admin/marking as no manual copy/paste is required.

Example:
- Place a csv called "Assignment 3.csv" in the same folder as the script with a column called "studnums"
- The script will create a new csv ("Assignment 3_processed.csv") with a row per entry of each student number in the "studnums" column
