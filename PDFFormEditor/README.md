# PDFFormEditor
Populates a PDF Form based on the data provided in a .csv file. Good for automatically generating ECSA forms for each student.

Expects an included .csv with a column for each field in an editable PDF.   
A good way to generate these forms is in Latex using the hyperref package. An example Latex Source for the ECSA form (used for EEE3096S 2019) is included.
