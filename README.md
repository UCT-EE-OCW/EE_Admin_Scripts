# ELO PDF Tool
Developed by Keegan Crankshaw to simplify ELO document renaming.  

Options for rotate, split, and rename.

A lot more work can be done on this (obviously) as it's very janky at the moment.  
Ideally, CLI should be developed to organise this. So if anyone wants to do that and make a PR, please feel free.
